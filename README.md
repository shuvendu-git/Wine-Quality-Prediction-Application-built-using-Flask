# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Application-built-using-Flask
This project predicts wine quality based on various chemical properties using a machine learning model.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Flask for the API
Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data processing and model building
Statsmodels for statistical analysis
Key Features:
Single and Batch Prediction: Users can predict wine quality through individual inputs or by uploading a CSV file.
Machine Learning Integration: A trained model (using Linear Regression) predicts wine quality based on attributes like acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content.
Data Preprocessing and VIF Filtering: To ensure optimal model performance, data preprocessing techniques were used, including VIF for multicollinearity filtering.
ðŸŒŸ Why This Project? This app was a great way to strengthen my skills in Flask API development and data preprocessing. It also gave me hands-on experience with key machine learning evaluation metrics.
